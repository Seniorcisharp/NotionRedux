# NOTION Project

Welcome to the **NOTION** project repository! This open-source application is designed to provide powerful tools for managing personal data and tasks. Developed and maintained by the community, NOTION aims to enhance productivity and organization.
This application was created for taking notes. But in order to create notes you need to register and log in.
